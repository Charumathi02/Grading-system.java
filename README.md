The program takes a numerical score from the user, compares it to set thresholds, and prints out the corresponding grade. The grading logic is based on the following ranges:

Scores greater than 90 are assigned an A.
Scores between 80 and 89 are assigned a B.
Scores between 70 and 79 are assigned a B.
Scores between 60 and 69 are assigned a B.
Scores below 60 are assigned an F.
